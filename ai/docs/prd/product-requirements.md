# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview
### Problem Statement
Dog owners often face challenges in finding trustworthy, vetted walkers quickly or for regular walks, causing stress and inconvenience. Similarly, dog walkers struggle to efficiently find clients and manage their schedules. Dog-Dash solves this by providing an on-demand platform that connects dog owners needing reliable pet care with walkers seeking flexible work opportunities—all in real time.

### Product Goal
Dog-Dash connects dog owners with nearby vetted walkers in real time, offering convenience for owners and flexible self-employment for walkers. The platform prioritizes dog safety and simplicity for both owners and walkers.

Dog-Dash is an on-demand dog walking platform inspired by Uber’s rider-sharing model, using real-time GPS tracking, dynamic walker availability, and seamless in-app payments.
